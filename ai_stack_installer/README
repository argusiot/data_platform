ArgusIoT service stack installer script.

Currently script is only tested on Vagrant.

But it works reliably to install - Hbase, OpenTSDB & Grafana on Vagrant.

Script will need some changes to reliably install on a new AWS instance. That
will be taken up as a follow-up activity.

To stand a service stack on a Vagrant VM involves 4 high level steps:
1. Creating an installer_bundle
2. Copying the installer bundle to the shared directory of your Vagrant VM
3. Launching the VM
4. Using the installer bundle inside the VM to create a new service stack


Detailed steps:
===============

To generate the service stack installer bundle:
-----------------------------------------------
git clone https://github.com/argusiot/data_platform
cd data_platform/ai_stack_installer
make installer_bundle
ls -l output/ai_stack_installer.tar (expect to find this file)

Create your new Vagrant VM to start a new stack:
------------------------------------------------
cd ~/HOME/new_stack
Initialize your Vagrantfile. Leave everything to default except uncomment this line:
  config.vm.network "public_network"
copy ai_stack_installer.tar to this file
vagrant up ; vagrant ssh
tar -xvf /vagrant/ai_stack_installer.tar
sudo /vagrant/argusiot_service_stack_install.sh

Verification:
--------------
See if the needed ports are up:
netstat -l | grep 4242 
netstat -l | grep 3000

4242 - OpenTSDB
3000 - Grafana

Capabilities now enabled:
-------------------------
 -- OpenTSDB R/W will now work
 -- Viewing from Grafana will still not work. That requires a small step of configuring the data source in Grafana. Ask Parag how to do that.
