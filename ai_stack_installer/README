ArgusIoT service stack installer script.

Currently script is only tested on Vagrant.

But it works reliably to install - Hbase, OpenTSDB & Grafana on Vagrant.

Script will need some changes to reliably install on a new AWS instance. That
will be taken up as a follow-up activity.

Usage with Vagrant VM involves 3 steps:
1. Creating an installer_bundle
2. Copying the installer bundle to the shared directory of your Vagrant VM
3. Launching the VM
4. You should expect to the see the installer bundle under /vagrant
5. Unbundle it
6. Run it.

========

To generate the service stack installer bundle:
git clone https://github.com/argusiot/data_platform
cd data_platform/ai_stack_installer
make installer_bundle
ls -l output/ai_stack_installer.tar (expect to find this file)

Create your new Vagrant VM to start a new stack:
cd ~/HOME/new_stack
initialize your Vagrantfile
copy ai_stack_installer.tar to this file
vagrant up ; vagrant ssh
tar -xvf /vagrant/ai_stack_installer.tar
sudo /vagrant/argusiot_service_stack_install.sh
