Quilt and Applique are names of systems designed to realize the requirements
laid out in the document above. The documents referred to the platform as
"Argus Data Processing" aka ADP. Hence in the doc above you'll see no mention
of Quilt or Applique.

Temporal State Specification grammar:
=====================================
  state_set = {t_state_1, t_state_2, ...}   (where t_state = Temporal State)
  t_state_i = expression
  expression = stmt_1 && stmt_2 && stmt_3 ...
  stmt_1 = timeseries_id operator constant
  timeseries_id = Timeseries id as defined in TSDB abstraction layer   (Leaf)
  operator = one_of{<, >, <=, >=, ==}       (Leaf)
  constant = one_of{integer | float}        (Leaf)
